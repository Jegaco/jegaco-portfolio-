## Description
## Challenge 02 Professional Portfolio
In this project we were tasked with creating a potential employee's portfolio of their work. This was challenging as now we are starting from scratch and building our web portfolio from start to finish.

## Challenges

The required criteria are as follows:
* WHEN I load their portfolio, THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation, THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work, THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application, THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

* WHEN I click on the images of the applications, THEN I am taken to that deployed application

* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Links
* [Link to the deployed website](https://jegaco.github.io/jegaco-portfolio-/)

* [Link to the code repository](https://github.com/Jegaco/jegaco-portfolio-)

## Preview
